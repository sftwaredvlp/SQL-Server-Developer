# SQL Server Developer Mastery

## A Complete Learning Path for SQL Server Development

This project is a comprehensive, hands-on learning resource designed to take you from SQL basics to professional-level SQL Server development. Based on the DataCamp SQL Server Developer career track, this project provides a structured, lesson-by-lesson approach to mastering T-SQL.

## Who Is This For?

- Aspiring SQL Server Developers
- Data Engineers wanting to strengthen their SQL foundations
- Backend developers needing database skills
- Anyone preparing for SQL Server certifications

## How to Use This Project

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine
2. **Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or Azure Data Studio
3. **Go through each folder in order** (01 → 10 → capstone)
4. **Type each script yourself** - don't copy/paste! Muscle memory matters.
